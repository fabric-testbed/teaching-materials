    "Next, ping various web servers and try to find the shortest RTT to a server outside of the aggregate. (hint, try popular websites) Note, ping will not work for some web servers because they have been configured not to respond to ICMP messages, or ICMP messages are blocked. For those completing this module for credit, \n",
