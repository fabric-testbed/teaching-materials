# FABRIC Educational Materials
# Tutorial: Traffic Analysis
## Introduction
The goal of this exercise is to give user hands-on experience using networking tools such as: ping, tcpdump, and ifconfig.
## Running the Tutorial
- The tutorial has three Jupyter notebooks:
    - **CreateSlice.ipynb**: Creates the FABRIC slice/topology needed for this tutorial
    - **Traffic_Analysis.ipynb**: Configures the IPv4/IPv6 network address, installs tools needed and then begins the Traffic tutorial
- To run the tutorial:
   - Login to the FABRIC Portal and JupyterHub
    	- Login to the [FABRIC Portal](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/)
    	- Login/connect to the [FABRIC JupyterHub](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/knowledge-base/creating-your-first-experiment-in-jupyter-hub/)
   - Download the latest copy of the tutorials from GitHub
    	- Open a terminal in JupyterHub by clicking the "Terminal" tile under "Other" in the Launcher tab
    	- In the terminal window, type the following commands to download (pull) the latest version of the set of tutorials from Github
```
        	mkdir teaching-materials
        	cd teaching-materials
        	git clone https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials.git
```

   - Run the Tutorial Notebooks
    	- In the left-hand column of JupyterHub, navigate to the Traffic Analysis tutorial
    	- Open and execute the CreateSlice.ipynb notebook
        - Then open and execute the steps on Traffic_Analysis.ipynb

## Overview of the Notebooks in this Tutorial

### Create Slice Notebook
- In this notebook you will request a slice that contains two nodes (Client and Server) and one Layer-2 networks (LAN) with the following configuration:
```
        	Client <-> LAN 1 <-> Server
```
- Each node should have the following requirements:
	- NIC_Basic model
	- "default_ubuntu_20" image
	- 1 cores
	- 2 ram
	- 10 disk space
 - To successfully run this notebook you should only need to run the code blocks in order from top to bottom
 - **Notes:** If your slice creation fails you can just try to specify a site in the second code block run them again. (you can get a site from "https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/" by looking at the map, use the name **outside** of the parenthesis and make sure the site chosen is up)

### Traffic Analysis Notebook
- To successfully run this notebook you need to run the code blocks first (*Setup Experiment*) and then run the experiment (*Run Experiment*):
	- Setup Experiment: This is the setup, run the provided Codeblocks to setup the network and to provide the correct addresses to each node.
    - Run Experiment: This is the Experiment, To complete this section just follow the provided instructions to understand the 5 sections: ifconfig, Adjust the MTU, ping, TCPdump, and, More on TCPdump options.
    - In this Assignment you will use what you have learned on the experiment to answer the questions in this assignment following the provided instructions. Lastly you will delete the slice to clear resources you used.
    - **Notes:** In the case the slice fails to delete please examine the experiment tab on the fabric portal and delete the corresponding slice if it was not already deleted
