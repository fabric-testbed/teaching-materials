# FABRIC Educational Materials
## Available Assignments
The upcoming assignments offer users an opportunity to acquaint themselves with a Linux environment concerning networking. They present step-by-step guidance to enhance comprehension of network functioning principles
### Introductiory Assignments - 
 - [Ping Layer](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/Ping.ipynb):
   + The goal of this exercise is to understand how the ping layer works in a network and an introduction of the ping command in linux along with iperf
 - [Exploring IPv6](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/Exploring%20IPV6):
   + The goal of this tutorial is to learn about IPv6 and to experiment with the IPv6 protocol and examine differences between IPv6 and IPv4.
 - [Round Trip Time and Window Size effect on TCP](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/RTT%20and%20Window%20Size%20on%20TCP) 
   + The goal of the this tutorial is is to understand how delay and the size of a window can affect data loss.

### Web Services - 
 - [Webserver](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/Webserver)
   + The goal of this exercise is to give user hands-on experience installing and interacting with a web server. User will install and start a web server, generate a simple HTML file, and use a client node to retrieve the file.

### Exploring Routing-   
 - [Routing with IPv4](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/IPV4%20routing):
   + The goal of this exercise is to understand how routing works in a network
 - [OSPF](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/OSPF):
   + The goal of this tutorial is to understand how OSPF works and to allow the user to experiment with the protocol first hand on how it can be used in a network
   
### Traffic Analysis
 - [Exploring Queues](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/Exploring%20Queues):
   + The goal of this tutorial is to understand how queues function in networking and to experiment how queues react with restrictions.
 - [TCP Traffic](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/TCP%20Traffic)
   + The Goal of this exercise is to show students how to generate traffic using iperf in a saw tooth behavior and the link it shares. Furthermore it will explain differences in UDP & TCP and how they interact with each other when they run simultaneously.
 - [Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/Traffic%20Analysis) 
   + The goal of this exercise is to give user hands-on experience using networking tools such as: ping, tcpdump, and ifconfig.
 - [Traffic Generation](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/tree/main/assignments/TrafficGeneration)
   + The goal of this exercise is to introduce the user to traffic generation using Nping

### Software Deployment
- [Exploring Ansible](./ExploringAnsible/CreateSlice.ipynb): 
    + Use ansible to configure and install a webserver-client relationship to two nodes
- [Systematic Experimentation](./SystematicExperimentation/CreateSlice.ipynb):
    + Use an ansible file to preconfigure a set of servers and nodes in a slice to place a customized topology using an ansible playbook.
