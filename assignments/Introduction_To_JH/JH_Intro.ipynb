    "## Step 1: Configuring Your Environment (Original Method):\n",
    "Welcome to JupyterHub, before you can start running your experiments you will need to upload ssh keys that allow you to connect to the virtual machines (VMs) that you can create from the jupyter examples, the teaching materials, or your own created experiments. To generate keys, you can use either create your own keys using your operating system and upload them to the fabric portal or create keys directly in the FABRIC portal under the “Experiments” tab. for information on how to create the Keys please see [ssh generation instructions](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/blob/main/Aditional%20Resources/Virtual%20Machine%20Key%20Instructions/Generating%20SSH%20Keys%20on%20Fabric%20Portal.md#approach-1--guide-to-generating-ssh-keys-on-fabric-portal) dont forget that you will need Bastion keys, not Sliver keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1:** The first step is to gather information:\n",
    "    - you will need to obtain your bastion login ID \n",
    "    - your Project ID \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The **Bastion Login** can be obtained from the \"Manage ssh Keys\" section under the experiment tab (https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/experiments#sshKeys), the blue box is what you will need.\n",
    "    <br><img src=\"./Figures/Bastion_Login.png\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The **Project ID** can be obtained from the \"Project & Slices tab\" (https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/experiments), just click on your project's name and you should get the project home page, the green box is the ID of your project.\n",
    "    <br><img src=\"./Figures/Project_ID.png\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Step 2:** Once you have located the ID's you will need to go back to JH and navigate to the \"fabric_config\" folder. In this folder you will upload both your private key, and your public key files.\n",
    "    <br><img src=\"./Figures/Config_Folder.png\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Step 3:** Navigate to the most reacent \"jupyter-examples-rel\" and open the \"Configure notebook\" you will need to replace the matching boxes with the information you have collected (replace the orange box with your key's name),  if you are unable to find it within the first directory, try up to the three previous Jupyter-examples, some versions may be place holders for future updates.\n",

    "## Step 1.1: Configuring Your Environment (New Alternative Method):\n",
    "In the most recent implementation of the jupyter examples a different form to configure the environment was added. If you have already configured your environment you may skip this section, however, if your keys have expired or you are new to JH you might find this method helpful. The \"Configure and Validate\" notebook allows the user to configure their environment by only needing to provide the ID of their FABRIC project. If you choose to use this method a bastion key and the sliver key will be created after you run this notebook as well as an ssh-config file. The first version of this notebook can be found under \"jupyter-examples-rel1.6.1\" as \"configure_and_validate.ipynb\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1:** Once you have located your project ID (see previous section) you will navigate to the most reasent \"jupyter-examples-rel1.X.X\" folder. In this folder you will open \"configure_and_validate.ipynb\" and edit the field in the green box with your project ID.\n",

In this notebook you usually only need to run the first cell (to get the node IPs of the experiment) and last Cell (delete the slice once you have Finished). You can run the cells individually with the single arrow button or together with the double arrow button, but keep in mind that you might need to run cells again once you get there so it is preferred to go step-by-step.\n",

    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "In this Section you will learn some useful information that can be applied outside the teaching materials as well,\n",
    "\n",
    "In the JupyterHub environment when a cell is queued to run there will be a ```[*]``` symbol next to the cell and will only change to a number ```[x]``` once the cell has fully ran, please keep in mind that even though the output may look finished when running items such as the \"Slice.submit()\" or \"slice.list_nodes()'' these items may actually take a while to run. Why is this important to know? The \"queuing\" does not traverse across different notebooks, so if you are creating a slice and immediately run the next notebook \"Assignment_X\", there is a high chance that most of the values will be missing in the best case, and worst case an error can be produced corrupting the slice and you will have to restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your experiment was set up correctly but you are unable to connect to your fabric topology network, a useful command to run in your nodes is \"ip a\". This command is useful because it allows you to take a look at the network status of any node. In some sites the Network Devices are initiated as \"Down\". If the devices are down you will not be able to run any traffic, so to bring them up by using \"sudo ip link set dev {device name} up\". In addition, if you are creating an experiment you can use this command to verify that the IPs you are assigning and the routes created (using ip route) are correct.\n",
