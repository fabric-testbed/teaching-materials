    "## Step 1: SSH key Uploads:\n",
    "Before you can start running your experiments you will need to upload ssh keys that allow you to connect to the virtual machines (VMs) that can be created from the jupyter examples, the teaching materials, or your own created experiments. To Generate Keys you can use either your own created keys uploaded to the portal or keys created directly from the FABRIC portal. for information on how to create the Keys please see [ssh generation instructions](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/blob/main/Aditional%20Resources/Virtual%20Machine%20Key%20Instructions/Generating%20SSH%20Keys%20on%20Fabric%20Portal.md#approach-1--guide-to-generating-ssh-keys-on-fabric-portal) dont forget That you will need bastion keys, not Sliver Keys\n",

    "    <img src=\"./Figures/Config_Folder.png\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Step 3:** Navigate to the most reacent \"jupyter-examples-rel\" and open the \"Configure notebook\" you will need to replace the matching boxes with the information you have collected (replace the orange box with your key's name),  if you are unable to find it within the first directory, try upto the three previous Jupyter-examples, some versions may be place holders for future updates.\n",

    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "In this Section you will learn some useful information that can be applied outside the Teaching materials as well\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyterhub environment when a cell is queued to run there will be a ```[*]``` symbol next to the cell and will only change to a number ```[x]``` once the cell has fully ran, please keep in mind that even though the output may look finished when running items such as the \"Slice.submit()\" or \"slice.list_nodes()'' these items may actually take a while to run. Why is this important to know? The \"queuing\" does not traverse across different notebooks, so if you are creating a slice and immediately run the next notebook \"Assignment_X\", there is a high chance that most of the values will be missing best case and worst case an error is produced and you will have to restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your experiment was set up correctly but you are unable to connect to your fabric topology network, a useful command to run in your nodes is \"ip a\". This command is useful because it allows you to take a look at the network status of any node. In some sites the Network Devices are initiated as \"Down\". If the devices are down you will not be able to run any traffic, so to bring them up use \"sudo ip link set dev {device name} up\". In addition if you are creating an experiment you can use this command to verify that the ip's you are assigning and the routes created (ip route) are correct.\n"
