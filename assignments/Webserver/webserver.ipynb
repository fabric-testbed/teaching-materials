    "<br> `wget -m -p 10.20.30.40`\n",
    "* This will produce a '10.20.30.40', server, with the following data structure. Run:\n",
    "<br> `ls 10.20.30.40`\n",
    "### 2.4 Build your own Server\n",
    "* At a high level, a web server listens for connections on a socket (bound to a specific port on a host machine). Clients connect to this socket and use a simple text-based protocol to retrieve files from the server. For example, you might try the following command on Client1:\n",
    "<br> `% telnet server 80`\n",
    "<br> `GET /index.html HTTP/1.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "(Type two carriage returns after the \"GET\" command). This will return to you (on the command line) the HTML representing the \"front page\" of the web server that is running on the Server host.)\n",

    "* Login to the Server host and run:\n",
    "<br> `ls /var/www/`\n",
    "This should give you a similar structure to the directory structure you got when you downloaded the whole site with wget on the previous steps."
