    "### 2.1.c standalone vs secure mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenFlow controller is responsible for setting up all flows on the switch, which means that when the controller is not running there should be no packet switching at all. Depending on the setup of your network, such a behavior might not be desired. It might be best that when the controller is down, the switch should default back to being a learning layer 2 switch. In other circumstances however this might be undesirable. In OVS this is a tunable parameter, called fail-safe-mode which can be set to the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **standalone** [default]: in this case OVS will take responsibility for forwarding the packets if the controller fails\n",
    "    **secure**: in this case only the controller is responsible for forwarding packets, and if the controller is down all packets are dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "In OVS when the parameter is not set it falls back to the standalone mode. For the purpose of this tutorial we will set the fail-safe-mode to secure, since we want to be the ones controlling the forwarding. \n"

    "2. To see messages go between your switch and your controller, open a new ssh window to your controller node and run tcpdump on the eth0 interface and on the tcp port that your controller is listening on usually 6633. (You can also run ```tcpdump``` on the ```OVS``` control interface if you desire.)\n",
    "<br>```sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 6633```\n",
    "<br>You will see (1) periodic keepalive messages being exchanged by the switch and the controller, (2) messages from the switch to the controller (e.g. when there is a table miss) and an ICMP Echo message in, and (3) messages from the controller to the switch (e.g. to install new flow entries). \n",
    "3. Kill your Ryu controller by pressing ```Ctrl-C```. \n",

    "### 2.5  Debugging your Controller\n",
    "While you are developing your controller, some useful debugging tools are:\n",
    "1. Print messages\n",
    "<br> Run your controller in verbose mode (add --verbose) and add print messages at various places to see what your controller is seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check the status in the switch\n",

    "3. Use Wireshark to see the OpenFlow messages\n",
    "<br>Many times it is useful to see the OpenFlow messages being exchanged between your controller and the switch. This will tell you whether the messages that are created by your controller are correct and will allow you to see the details of any errors you might be seeing from the switch. <br>You can use wireshark on both ends of the connection, in hardware switches you have to rely only on the controller view.\n",
    "<br>The controller host and OVS has wireshark installed, including the openflow dissector. For more information on wireshark you can take a look at the [wireshark wiki](http://wiki.wireshark.org/).\n",
    "<br> Here we have a simple case of how to use the OpenFlow dissector for wireshark.\n",
    "<br> If you are on a Linux friendly machine (this includes MACs) open a terminal and ssh to your controller machine using the -Y command line argument, i.e.\n",
    "<br> ```ssh -Y <username>@<controller>```\n",
    "<br> Assuming that the public IP address on the controller is eth0, run wireshark by typing:\n",
    "<br> ```sudo wireshark -i eth0& ```\n",
    "<br> however we are going to skip this step since we dont have a display.\n",
    "When the wireshark window pops up, you might still have to choose eth0 for a live capture. And you will want to use a filter to cut down on the chatter in the wireshark window. One such filter might be just seeing what shows up on port 6633. To do that type tcp.port eq 6633 in the filter window, assuming that 6633 is the port that the controller is listening on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Run a traffic duplication controller\n",
    "In the above example we ran a very simple learning switch controller. \n",
    "\n",
    " The power of OpenFlow comes from the fact that you can decide to forward the packet anyway you want based on the supported OpenFlow actions. A very simple but powerful modification you can do, is to duplicate all the traffic of the switch out a specific port. This is very useful for application and network analysis. You can imagine that at the port where you duplicate traffic you connect a device that does analysis. For this tutorial we are going to verify the duplication by doing ```tcpdump``` on two ports on the OVS switch.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Use the interfaces that are connected to ```host2``` and ```host3```**.\n",
    "    - Software Switch (OVS): You should have noted down the interfaces for host2 and host3 in section 2.1.a. If you have not noted the interfaces for host2 and host3 down (in section 2a), you can run tcpdump on OVS interfaces to figure out the interfaces for host2 and host3. This will allow you to see all traffic going out the interfaces.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>To see that duplication is happening, on the OVS host, run:\n",
    "<br> ```sudo tcpdump -i <data_interface_name_to_host2>   ```\n",
    "<br> ```sudo tcpdump -i <data_interface_name_to_host3>   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see traffic from host1 to host2 showing up in the tcpdump window for host3. As a comparison, you will notice that no traffic shows up in that window when the controller is running the learning switch (at /tmp/ryu, type ./bin/ryu-manager ryu/ext/simple_switch.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In the controller host directory** ```/tmp/ryu/ryu/ext``` **you should see two files**: \n",
    "<br>**i.** **myDuplicateTraffic.py** : This is the file that has instructions about how to complete the missing information. Go ahead and try to implement your first controller.\n",
    "<br>**ii.** **DuplicateTraffic.py**: This has the actual solution. You can just run this if you don't want to bother with writing a controller.\n",
    "<br>**iii.** **duplicate.config**: in this file, you need to specify which port you want to duplicate traffic to. We will be duplicating host2 traffic and send it to host3, so put host3 port number here. We noted down port numbers in section 2a. To figure out which port maps to which interface, use can also use \"sudo ovs-ofctl show br0\" on ovs node. (You can use any editor to edit the file, e.g. use nano by typing \"sudo nano duplicate.config\") \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run your newly written controller to duplicate the traffic. (update duplicate.config file with host3 port number. We noted it down in section 2a ). You can also use the solution file DuplicateTraffic.py to duplicate traffic:\n",
    "<br> ```cd ~/ryu ```\n",
    "<br> ```ryu-manager ryu/ext/myDuplicateTraffic.py ```\n",
    "<br> *note* if you get errors tryng to run the experiments in the **Ext** dir the utils file might be corrupted, please download the utils.py script [here]() and place it under ~/ryu/ryu/ext, by uploading it to the node or using wget on the directory\n",
    "4. To test it go to the terminal of host1 and try to ping host2:\n",
    "<br> ```ping 10.10.1.2 ```\n",
    "<br> If your controller is working, your packets will register in both terminals running tcpdump. \n",

    "Now let's do a slightly more complicated controller. OpenFlow gives you the power to overwrite fields of your packets at the switch, for example the TCP source or destination port and do port forwarding. You can have clients trying to contact a server at port 5000, and the OpenFlow switch can redirect your traffic to a service listening on port 6000.\n",
