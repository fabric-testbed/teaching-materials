# FABRIC Educational Materials
# Tutorial: TCP Traffic
## Introduction
The Goal of this exercise is to show students how to generate traffic using iperf in a saw tooth behavior and the link it shares. Furthermore it will explain differences in UDP & TCP and how they interact with each other when they run simultaneously.
## Running the Tutorial
- The tutorial has three Jupyter notebooks and one folder:
    - **CreateSlice.ipynb**: Creates the FABRIC slice/topology needed for this tutorial
    - **TCP_Traffic.ipynb**: Configures the IPv4/IPv6 network address, installs tools needed and then begins the TCP tutorial
    - **Assignment.ipynb**: Contains questions/tasks to be answered
- To run the tutorial:
   - Login to the FABRIC Portal and JupyterHub
    	- Login to the [FABRIC Portal](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/)
    	- Login/connect to the [FABRIC JupyterHub](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/knowledge-base/creating-your-first-experiment-in-jupyter-hub/)
   - Download the latest copy of the tutorials from GitHub
    	- Open a terminal in JupyterHub by clicking the "Terminal" tile under "Other" in the Launcher tab
    	- In the terminal window, type the following commands to download (pull) the latest version of the set of tutorials from Github
```
        	mkdir teaching-materials
        	cd teaching-materials
        	git clone https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials.git
```

   - Run the Tutorial Notebooks
    	- In the left-hand column of JupyterHub, navigate to the TCP Traffic tutorial
    	- Open and execute the CreateSlice.ipynb notebook
        - Then open and execute the TCP_Traffic.ipynb
        - Then open and execute the Assignment.ipynb

## Overview of the Notebooks in this Tutorial

### Create Slice Notebook
- In this notebook you will request a slice that contains two nodes (Client and Server) and one Layer-2 networks (LAN) with the following configurations:
```
        	Client <-> LAN 1 <-> Server
```
- Each node should have the following requirements:
	- NIC_Basic model
	- "default_ubuntu_20" image
	- 1 cores
	- 2 ram
	- 10 disk space
 - To successfully run this notebook you should only need to run the code blocks in order from top to bottom
 - **Notes:** If your slice creation fails you can just try to specify a site in the second code block run them again. (you can get a site from "https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/" by looking at the map, use the name **outside** of the parenthesis and make sure the site chosen is up)
  - **Notes:** It can also be the case that your project does not have access to more than 10GB of disk space, you will then have to change the disk space to 10 in the second cell at "create slice" notebook, step **2.2.4 will be 30 seconds instead of 90** and **2.2.5 will be 10 seconds instead of 30** in the "TCP_Traffic" notebook

### TCP Traffic Notebook
- To successfully run this notebook you need to run the code blocks first (*Setup Experiment*) and then run the experiment (*Run Experiment*):
	- Setup Experiment: This is the setup, run the provided Codeblocks to setup the network and to provide the correct addresses to each node.
    - Run Experiment: This is the Experiment, To complete this section just follow the provided instructions to understand the 2 sections: Iperf in One Direction and TCP vs UDP.
- **Notes:**
   + if you run out of memory during the assignment be sure to re-try the assignment increasing the disk space by 50 - 100, if the problem persist lower the time the ss program is running.
   + Do not run iperf with the graphing script for more than 2 minutes to avoid memory errors
### Assignment Notebook
- In this Assignment you will experiment with inputs to the commands to test the capabilities of the nodes transfer rate.
- **Notes:** In the case the slice fails to delete please examine the experiment tab on the fabric portal and delete the corresponding slice if it was not already deleted
