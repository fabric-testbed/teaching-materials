    "<br> Running iperf can be done in ether direction you would just need to use the commands on the opposite terminals with the correct ip for the second command, You can all ways find the ip in linux using ether \"ifconfig\" or \"ip a\", the ip for your node in the network should be under \"enp7s0\"\n",
