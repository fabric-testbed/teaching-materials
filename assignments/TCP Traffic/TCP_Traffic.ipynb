    "iperf is a tool for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance. In this section we will measure from client to server.\n",
    "1. In the Server SSH terminal, start the iperf with the following command: ```iperf -s``` \n",

    "<br> The \"-s\" indicates that the node will run in server mode. Likewise the \"-c\" is client mode. The \"-i 10\" tells iperf to print updates every 10 seconds, and \"-t 180\" to run for 180 before closing the connection.\n",
    "<br> Running iperf can be done in either direction. You would just need to use the commands on the opposite terminals with the correct ip for the second command. You can always find the ip in linux using either \"ifconfig\" or \"ip a\". The ip for your node in the network should be under \"ens#\"\n",

    "### 2.2 TCP vs UDP\n",
    "In this exercise we will see the link that the TCP and UDP traffic share when they are running simultaneously. We will use iperf to generate the traffic between the nodes and see how the congestion control will affect the output.\n",
    "1. Start 2 terminals on node A and a two terminals on node B\n",
    "2. First we will start the servers on the first terminal of node A. Run the following command to start the UDP server and the TCP servers: ```iperf -s -i 15 & iperf -s -u -i 10```. The TCP server will print information every 15 seconds, and the UDP server will print information every 10 seconds.\n",
    "3. On the second A terminal prepare to run the script: ```./ss-output.sh```. This will catch packets so that you are able to analyze the traffic changes in this experiment.\n",
    "4. Start the script on terminal A and then immediately run the following command: ```iperf -c <nodeA> -t 90 ```. On the first node B terminal, this start the tcp trafic and will run for 90 seconds (1.5 minutes).\n",
    "6. After 30 seconds run the following command: ```iperf -c <NodeA> -t 30 -u -b 200m```. On the second B terminal this will start sending UDP traffic at the same time as TCP traffic. This will run for a minute.\n",
    "<br><img src=\"https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials/blob/main/assignments/TCP%20Traffic/figures/TUT.png?raw=true\"><br>\n",
    "7. Once the traffic stops for both nodes stop the command on the second A terminal by hitting ```Ctrl-C```. This command should take about 3-5 more minutes depending on the hardware and site you used.\n"
