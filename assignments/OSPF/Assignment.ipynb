    "The hello interval and dead interval values can be configured in the ospfd configuration located at /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf. Modify this file on each of the nodes, adding two lines below each interface like this:\n",

    "<br> `ip ospf dead-interval 5`\n",

    "1. From your experience in the main part of the experiment, before you made changes, what is the default value of the dead-interval for this implementation of OSPF?\n",
    "2. After making the above changes, what is different in how OSPF responds to broken links?\n",
    "3. What types of networks would shorter hello-interval and dead interval values be more suited for?\n",
