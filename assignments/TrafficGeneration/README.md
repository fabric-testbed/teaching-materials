# FABRIC Educational Materials
# Tutorial: Traffic Generation
## Introduction
The goal of this exercise is to introduce the user to traffic generation using Nping
## Running the Tutorial
- The tutorial has three Jupyter notebook:
    - **CreateSlice.ipynb**: Creates the FABRIC slice/topology needed for this tutorial
    - **TrafficGeneration.ipynb**: Configures the IPv4/IPv6 network address, installs tools needed and then begins the Traffic tutorial
- To run the tutorial:
   - Login to the FABRIC Portal and JupyterHub
    	- Login to the [FABRIC Portal](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/)
    	- Login/connect to the [FABRIC JupyterHub](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/knowledge-base/creating-your-first-experiment-in-jupyter-hub/)
   - Download the latest copy of the tutorials from GitHub
    	- Open a terminal in JupyterHub by clicking the "Terminal" tile under "Other" in the Launcher tab
    	- In the terminal window, type the following commands to download (pull) the latest version of the set of tutorials from Github
```
        	mkdir teaching-materials
        	cd teaching-materials
        	git clone https://github.com/fabric-testbed/teaching-materials.git
```

   - Run the Tutorial Notebooks
    	- In the left-hand column of JupyterHub, navigate to the Traffic Generation tutorial
    	- Open and execute the CreateSlice.ipynb notebook
        - Then open and execute the steps on TrafficGeneration.ipynb
## Overview of the Notebooks in this Tutorial

### Create Slice Notebook
- In this notebook you will request a slice that contains two nodes (ND1 and ND2) and one Layer-2 networks (LAN) with the following configuration:
```
        	ND1 <-> LAN 1 <-> ND2
```
- Each node should have the following requirements:
	- NIC_Basic model
	- "default_ubuntu_20" image
	- 1 cores
	- 2 ram
	- 10 disk space
 - To successfully run this notebook you should only need to run the code blocks in order from top to bottom
 - **Notes:** If your slice creation fails you can just try to specify a site in the second code block run them again. (you can get a site from "https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/" by looking at the map, use the name **outside** of the parenthesis and make sure the site chosen is up)

### Traffic Generation Notebook
- To successfully run this notebook you need to run the code blocks first (*Setup Experiment*) and then run the experiment (*Run Experiment*):
	- Setup Experiment: This is the setup, run the provided Codeblocks to setup the network and to provide the correct addresses to each node.
    - Run Experiment: This is the Experiment, To complete this section just follow the provided instructions to complete the introduction to  N-ping.
    - In this Assignment you will answer questions and use what you learned to create a graph of the traffic generated by nping.
    - **Notes:** In the case the slice fails to delete please examine the experiment tab on the fabric portal and delete the corresponding slice if it was not already deleted.
