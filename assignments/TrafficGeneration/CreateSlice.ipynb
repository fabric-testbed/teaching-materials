    "In the 'EDUKY' site, we will reserve a set of 2 nodes arranged in a line, with one node designated as a server and the other as a client. Each node will have the following specifications: 1 CPU core, 2GB of RAM, and 10GB of storage capacity. The each node will have 1 network cards (NICs) to communicate with each other, We will call the server \"Node_1\" and the card \"ND_A\" and the client we will be \"Node_2\" and it's port \"ND_B\". The bridge connecting the two nodes is an l2network called \"Lan\". All nodes will be preloaded with an 'Ubuntu' Linux OS. Upon submission, the slice will be named 'TrafficGeneration'."
