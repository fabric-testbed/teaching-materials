# Signing up for a FABRIC Account

**Warning: Please Read Carefully**

Before proceeding with the sign-up process, ensure you follow these important steps to prevent enrollment issues:

1. **Accept Cookie Policy:** Make sure you accept the cookie policy on the FABRIC portal (https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/). Skipping this step could prevent successful enrollment.

2. **Use Institutional Login:** Currently, FABRIC requires the use of your institutional login via CI Logon. Using other options like Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or ORCID might require extra approvals and should be avoided whenever possible.

3. **Verify Email URL:** In case the confirmation email URL is mangled due to email system protection, copy-paste the mangled URL into the provided website to decode it.
