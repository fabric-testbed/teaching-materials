# Creating or Joining a Project

**Warning: Important Steps**

Before proceeding with creating or joining a project, keep in mind these crucial steps to ensure a smooth process:

1. **Project Lead Role:** Only users with the Project Lead role can create new projects and add members. If needed, request the Project Lead role via the Portal User Profile/My Roles & Projects page.

2. **Project Purpose and Membership:** When creating a new project, carefully consider its purpose and membership. FABRIC permissions are granted per-project. Provide a meaningful description for the project (public by default) and choose its visibility (public or private).

3. **Joining a Project:** After enrolling your account, you must join an active project to access the FABRIC testbed. Project Owners or Leads can add you to a project.

## Creating a Project

1. Once granted the Project Lead role, navigate to the Experiments/Projects & Slices page to create a new project.

2. Ensure to provide a clear description for the project. Public projects are searchable by other FABRIC users. You can mark your project as private in the 'Basic Information' tab.

## Joining a Project

1. Access the FABRIC portal with your enrolled account.

2. You must be added to an active project to use the testbed. Ask a Project Owner or Lead to add you.

3. Project Owners or Leads can add members by:
   - Navigating to the project via Experiments/Projects & Slices or User Profile/My Roles & Projects.
   - Using the search box to find the user you want to add (at least 4 consecutive letters of email or name required for search).
   - Clicking 'Add' next to their name.

4. **Important:** Currently, the only way to join a project is through the project owner. Contact your professor or research lead to be added to your team's project.

5. The portal also supports adding multiple project members via a CSV file. Use the 'Batch Upload' tab and follow the prompts. Don't forget to click 'Save' after adding all members.

6. **Note:** Adding multiple members via Batch option might take some time. Project membership manipulation will be locked until the process completes. A banner will notify you when the process is done, indicating any errors if they occurred.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure clear communication with Project Leads and Owners. If you're not added to a project, contact your professor or research lead for assistance.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during project creation or joining, reach out to the FABRIC support team for guidance.
