9. **Follow the Flow:**
   - The "start-here" notebook provides links to various examples. Follow the suggested flow of notebooks to explore different FABRIC features.
   - Start by running the "Configure Environment" notebook to set up your container configuration, including SSH keys, SSH configuration file, and FABlib configuration file.

10. **Run the "Hello, FABRIC" Example:**
   - Within the examples, choose the "Hello, FABRIC" example notebook.
   - Open the notebook and run the cells to see how the FABRIC Python API works.
